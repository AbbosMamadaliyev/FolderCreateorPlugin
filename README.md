# Folder Creator Plugin

## Purpose and Features

The **Folder Creator Plugin** is designed to help you quickly set up a well-organized project structure based on Test Driven Development (TDD) principles in IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, and other IntelliJ-based IDEs. Not only does the plugin create the essential folder hierarchy, but it also automatically generates boilerplate Dart code files for each architectural layer.

### What It Does

When you invoke the plugin, it generates a folder structure and code files based on the folder name you provide. For example, if you enter "auth" as the folder name, the plugin will create:

- **data/datasources/auth_datasource.dart**  
  Contains an abstract datasource class and its implementation.
- **data/repositories/auth_repository_impl.dart**  
  Contains a concrete repository implementation.
- **data/models/auth_model.dart**  
  Contains a model class with JSON serialization stubs.
- **domain/repositories/auth_repository.dart**  
  Contains an abstract repository interface.
- **domain/entities/auth_entity.dart**  
  Defines the domain entity.
- **presentation/auth_screen.dart**  
  Contains a basic stateful widget screen.

## How It Works

1. **Select a Folder and Enter a Name:**  
   Right-click on the desired folder in your project, choose **New > Create TDD Folders**, and then enter a folder name (e.g., `auth`).

2. **Automatic Generation:**  
   
   It then generates boilerplate Dart code files in the respective folders, customized to the provided folder name.

## Example Structure and Code

If you input "auth" as your folder name, the generated project structure will look like:
